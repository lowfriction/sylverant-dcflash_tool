What is Dreamcast Flashrom Tool?
--------------------------------
Dreamcast flashrom tool is a simple tool for manipulating the data stored on the
internal flashrom of a Dreamcast console. Simply put, it is mostly aimed at
people who play the Phantasy Star Online series of games, but it is still
potentially useful for those who don't (especially if you intend to sell a
console that you've used to play online games in the past).

The tool has three main useful operations that it can perform:
1. Display the serial numbers used on the console to play Phantasy Star Online
2. Delete the serial numbers used to play PSO from the console
3. Delete game settings, PSO serial numbers, and ISP information (probably
   amongst other data) from the console

Of these operations, #3 is especially useful before selling a console, to ensure
that potentially private data is not given inadvertently to the next owner of
the console (specifically, your ISP/email login information and your PSO serial
numbers).

All operations that make changes to the console require confirmation before they
can be run. Unless you're mashing a bunch of buttons on your controller, there
should not be any way to inadvertently delete data from your console. However,
I don't promise anything. ;-)

There are also a number of other operations that were added to the program
mainly for my own debugging purposes. These operations are not useful unless you
load the program with dcload/dc-tool, and they serve fairly little purpose
outside of debugging the program itself, so they will not be discussed further
here.


Why not just include this with the PSO Patcher?
-----------------------------------------------
At some point, I might include it with the Sylverant PSO Patcher as an extra
utility, however at the current time it is not written in a way that makes that
convenient or easy.
